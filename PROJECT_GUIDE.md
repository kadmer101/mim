## üéØ Purpose Reminder

> **The Global Final Challenge**: "If anyone can prove a real mistake in Islam, they win 999 USDT. Otherwise, every question is publicly answered ‚Äî ending Islamophobia with full transparency."

This platform serves as the definitive, transparent, and financially-backed challenge to anyone who believes they have found contradictions or errors in Islam. Through community-driven investigation, expert scholarly review, and permanent public documentation, we aim to:

1. **Address Every Concern**: No question or challenge goes unanswered
2. **Ensure Transparency**: All processes are public and auditable  
3. **Provide Incentives**: Real financial rewards for genuine discoveries
4. **Build Knowledge**: Create the world's most comprehensive Islamic Q&A resource
5. **Combat Islamophobia**: Replace ignorance and prejudice with facts and understanding

The platform's success will be measured not just by technical metrics, but by its contribution to interfaith understanding, reduction of religious prejudice, and the creation of a more informed global dialogue about Islam.
